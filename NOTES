----------------
AlphaTransfer is defined as a function of data and position
ColorTransfer is defined as a function of data position and normal.

However, when shadow rays are computed, normals passed into the ColorTransfer is
set as (0,0,0). We are ignoring color transfer due to normal for shadow computation.
This is only done for the sake of rendering speed for the moment.
